            <h2>About</h2>
            This week we lost a great example of leadership. Max DePree was 92. Through his personal example and insightful writing, he influenced millions of people regarding how we do leadership.

            Upon learning of Maxâ€™s death, the first thing that came to mind was this example of his influence written by a university president back in 2000. He wrote this about Max.<br>              <br>   Several years ago Max DePree came to speak to our university trustees. Max, as most of you know, is a successful businessman and a prominent and wise voice on leadership. The day after Max and Esther left, we received a call from the hotel manager where they had stayed. This manager was amazed. He said that Mr. DePree had made a huge impact on his staff. Everyone was talking about his kindness, about the generosity of his spirit. This manager thanked me for sending this guest. His staff would never be the same, he said.<br>    <br> To know more about him visit this link</div>
